HORN DEESIGN
===

This is a hobby project to design a Horn from start to end.

1. Defining acoustic inner diameter profile.
2. Calculating acoustic input impedance.
3. Designing basic parts such as bell, body, slides, valve section, mouthpipe, mouthpiece, levers...
4. Assembling all parts to form a complete instrument.
